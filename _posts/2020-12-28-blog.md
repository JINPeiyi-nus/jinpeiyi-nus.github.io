Financial Sophistication and Consumer Spending

Measures of goodness-of-fit
------
* the adjusted $R^2$

which adjusts for the number of predictor variables; 
* the square root of the mean squared error (RMSE); 
* the mean absolute error (MAE); 
* the correlation between actual and predicted mistakes (Pearson’s Correlation).

Across all four goodness-of-fit measures, the goodness-of-fit increases substantially when we include a customer fixed effect. For example, using the adjusted R2, we see that the only 4% of the variability in avoidable late fees is explained in a linear model by age, income, credit score, and liquid and total assets. When we include a customer fixed effect, the adjusted R2 increases by more than sixfold, from 0.04 to 0.27.

Variance decomposition
------
A simple variance decomposition corroborates these findings. Using customer-month ob- servations, I decompose the variance in the frequency and cost of financial mistakes into the variance between customers plus the variance within customers: $var(y_it)=var(E[y_it|i])+E[var(y_it|i)]$ where i denotes a customer, and t a month. I find that the ”explained” or ”between customer” variance, $var(E[y_it|i])$, accounts for 25% (35%) of the variance in the frequency (cost) of the variance in avoidable late fees and 24% (32%) of the variance in the frequency (cost) of the variance in avoidable overdraft fees.
